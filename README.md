## Sacrifices Must Be Made

In this 2D roguelike, survival comes at a cost. After every wave of enemies, you must make a sacrifice to continue. Each choice takes something away â€” maybe your health, your stamina, your speed, or even your vision itself.

Every run is different, and every sacrifice changes how you play. Can you survive long enough when everything you give up makes you weaker, blinder, and slower?

How much are you willing to lose to win?
